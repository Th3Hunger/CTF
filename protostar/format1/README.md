# Protostar - format1 

in this challenge as we know if we say 
```C
printf("%n");
```
%n will get the first value of the stack and then write to this address the number of characters before it , so what we need to do is to fill the stack until make the address of the target at the top to make %n take it and then change the value of the target with any value so the condition will be true.
